Tools used for data QA are:
  Pandera  : It is python+Pandas library. Used for Statistical type-checking and validation of dataframes. pandera provides three validation backends: pandas, pyspark, and polars.Its disadvantage is validations might add performance overhead when checking very large DataFrames
  Great expectations  : It is a python based open source library used for validating, documenting and profiling the data set.First step is to define rules(expectations). Then validate if the data meets expectations. Then document data. Its advantage is expectation is easy to read and understand(human readable). Its disadvantage is itcan be complex to set up initially, especially for non-technical users, like Pandera, validations on large datasets may slow down workflows.
  Deequ (by AWS) : It is written in Scala. Open source library built by Amazon by defining unit testson large scale datasets using Apache spark. Its advantages are built for big data, code based and reproducible. Its disadvantages are less user friendly, limited python support.
  Apache Griffin  : Used in big data ecosystems like Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, or Hive.Its advantages are built for big data and it has extinsible architecture. Its disadvantages areComplex Setup and Maintenance, need to understand big data tools (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Hive) and Focus on Large-Scale Use Cases.
  Pytest+Pandas  : Simple python test using pytest. Perform unit test on data pipelines.pytest is combined with pandas to validate data content. Its advantages are easy to use and flexible, works well with pandas dataframe, community and documentation. Its disadvantages are not always well-suited for complex data pipelines and limited support for deep comparison
